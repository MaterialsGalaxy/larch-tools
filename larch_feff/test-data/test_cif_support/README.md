This directory is intended to test that the ``larch_feff.py`` tool generates valid FEFF input files for various cif files.
Each subdirectory here corresponds to a different cif file. To run a test for a certain cif file, enter the
corresponding directory, and then run a command such as::

  python <path-to-larch-feff>/larch_feff.py <name-of-cif>.cif larch_feff_parameters.json

All being well the result will be that a file ``out.csv`` and a directory ``feff`` will be created therein. The file
``feff/feff.inp`` is the FEFF input file generated by ``larch_feff.py``.

For some of the cif files a FEFF input file ``benchmark.inp`` is provided. These files have been obtained using the
notebooks at https://github.com/UK-Catalysis-Hub/XAS-Workflow-Demo/tree/main/psdi_phase_1/larch by Abraham Nieva de la
Higalda. Currently the difference in the FEFF input files generated by Abraham's notebooks and our tool is that
our tool creates lines such as the following in the FEFF input files, while Abraham's notebooks do not::

  HOLE    1  1.0  * Pd K edge, around 24350 eV (2nd number is S02)
  CONTROL 1 1 1 0 * phase, paths, feff, chi
  PRINT   1 0 0 0
  RMAX    5.00
  EXCHANGE 0

This can be seen by using ``diff`` from within one of the subdirectories in order to compare the two FEFF input files,
e.g.::

  diff benchmark.inp feff/feff.inp

I'm not sure of the significance of these differences yet.
